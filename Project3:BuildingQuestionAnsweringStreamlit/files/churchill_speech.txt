Winston Churchill Speech - We Shall Fight on the Beaches
We Shall Fight on the Beaches
June 4, 1940
House of Commons
From the moment that the French defenses at Sedan and on the Meuse were broken at the end of the second week
of May, only a rapid retreat to Amiens and the south could have saved the British and French Armies who had
entered Belgium at the appeal of the Belgian King; but this strategic fact was not immediately realized. The
French High Command hoped they would be able to close the gap, and the Armies of the north were under their
orders. Moreover, a retirement of this kind would have involved almost certainly the destruction of the fine
Belgian Army of over 20 divisions and the abandonment of the whole of Belgium. Therefore, when the force and
scope of the German penetration were realized and when a new French Generalissimo, General Weygand,
assumed command in place of General Gamelin, an effort was made by the French and British Armies in Belgium
to keep on holding the right hand of the Belgians and to give their own right hand to a newly created French Army
which was to have advanced across the Somme in great strength to grasp it.

Turning once again, and this time more generally, to the question of invasion, I would observe that there has never
been a period in all these long centuries of which we boast when an absolute guarantee against invasion, still less
against serious raids, could have been given to our people. In the days of Napoleon the same wind which would
have carried his transports across the Channel might have driven away the blockading fleet. There was always the
chance, and it is that chance which has excited and befooled the imaginations of many Continental tyrants. Many
are the tales that are told. We are assured that novel methods will be adopted, and when we see the originality of
malice, the ingenuity of aggression, which our enemy displays, we may certainly prepare ourselves for every kind
of novel stratagem and every kind of brutal and treacherous maneuver. I think that no idea is so outlandish that it
should not be considered and viewed with a searching, but at the same time, I hope, with a steady eye. We must
never forget the solid assurances of sea power and those which belong to air power if it can be locally exercised.
I have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are
made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once again able to defend our Island home, to ride out the
storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for years, if necessary alone. At any rate, that is
what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His Majesty's Government-every man of them. That is the
will of Parliament and the nation. The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and
in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their
strength. Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip
of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we
shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing
strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall
fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall
never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated
and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the
struggle, until, in God's good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the
liberation of the old.
